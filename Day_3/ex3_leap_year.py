# This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.

# on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 

# **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 

# **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0):

elif (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0 and year % 400 == 0):
    print ("Leap year.")

# ##First Attempt 
# if (year % 4 == 0): 
#     #print("Leap Year")

#     if (year % 100 == 0):

#given solution
if year % 4 == 0:
    if year % 100 == 0:
        if year % 400 == 0: 
            print("Leap year")

            print("Not leap year")
    else:
        print("Leap year")
else:
    print("Not leap year")

##another solution## 
if year % 4 > 0:
  print("Not leap year.")
elif year % 400 == 0:
    print("Leap year.")
elif year % 100 == 0:
  print("Not leap year.")
else:
  print("Leap year.")

##Use Boolean##
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
 
isLeapYear = False
 
if year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0):
  isLeapYear = True
 
if isLeapYear:
  print("Leap year.")
else:
  print("Not leap year.")
